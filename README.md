# MyMartlet - Android

## Summary
The MyMartlet app provides a mobile portal to McGill University students to McGill's MyMcGill. It gives the user access to all of the essential MyMcGill features, such as schedule, transcript, ebill, adding/dropping courses, a campus map, and more. 
This is an unofficial McGill app, and is not affiliated with McGill University whatsoever. [Download it from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.appvelopers.mcgillmobile).
