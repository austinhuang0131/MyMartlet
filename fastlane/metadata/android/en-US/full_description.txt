MyMartlet is a mobile app that will be convenient for every student in McGill University. With the intention of creating mobile platform for MyMcGill portal, this application allows McGill students to easily access various information such as schedules and transcripts simply by logging into the app with the McGill email account. You can also register and drop classes as well as creating a wishlist of courses you may want to take at McGill. The application also includes detailed campus map with filtering options and directions so you can find your class buildings or your favorite McGill food services . You can even customize your own map by filtering your favorite locations so that only they will show on the map. As a bonus, we include a quick walkthrough so that you can set up your McGill email with your native Android email app. All features are available in both English and French for your convenience.

MyMartlet is not official and was not created by McGill University. It was created independently by McGill students.
